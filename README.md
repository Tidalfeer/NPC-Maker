# Who the F@CK is this NPC?
### Application Overview
**Who the F@CK is this NPC?** is a web application that will allow users to create NPCs (Non-Playable Characters)  for their Tabletop Roleplaying Games (TTRPGs) at the click of a button. Whether the user wants to choose every aspect of the character, build from a template or randomize everything, our site will oblige.

Game Masters (GMs), people who run TTRPGs for a group of players, are terribly busy. They need to craft an elaborate story within a world of their creation filled with adventure, creatures, and quests. Moreover, they need to populate that world with NPCs to give out these quests and adventures.

There are plenty of character creators out there but there are far fewer NPC specific creators that deliver an NPC complete with stats and a backstory. This unique site will support the basic ruleset of the most popular TTRPG currently, D&D, but these NPCs could easily be used for any game with small modifications to suit your ruleset.  

## Features

### Manual Fill
The character sheet is a fully editable form that allows you to create a character manually. Upon selecting the character race, the Racial Abilities section will populate. This section will auto-fill whenever you select a new race and can be edited for customization.

You can edit everything from name to their individual skills. There is a notes section to gather your thoughts and a languages section were you can fill in what languages work for your campaign setting. 

The clear button will let you completely start over when you are ready to make your next character.

There is currently no save function so please take a screenshot of your character when completed.

### Random Fill

If you are low on time or looking for new ideas you can get a fully random character.

Clicking randomize provides a class, race and subrace as well as ability scores, skills and saving throws. The character speed, alignment and size also fill in randomly. The name section is filled with a randomized number that you can use to keep track of your ideas. 

### Recommended Fill
A randomized character can have some pretty wild stats so if you are looking for something more by-the-book you can use our recommended generation.

Clicking recommended provides a class, race and subrace as well as ability scores that are tailored to the selector race and class. The speed will also fill in with the speed as determined by the race. With this option you can still randomize a new NPC while still having a well built character. You can select skills, saving throws, size, and alignment manually for extra customization.

### Backstory Generator
Lastly, your NPC is going to need a story. What will you say when the players start asking about the NPC's history? 

That's where our *What the F@CK is this NPCs backstory?* feature comes in.

Randomly generate nearly endless stories to give your NPC a birthplace, parentage, a childhood home and family wealth. This also generates the NPCs lifestyle, occupation and two unique life events. This feature is thanks to WTF Engine filling in the blanks of a madlibs-esque story outline.

***Now f@ck off and go make some NPCs!***
